            …And yet,
            Your heart intertwined with mine,
            Dancing like we have infinite time
            What is this feeling?
            A unique type of healing
            A love… divine
            
            I want to be here forever
            I want to hold you near, whenever
            Bless me with your smile
            And never let go, ever
            
            I know this dance will end,
            I know this is temporary…

        How come we’re not meant to be
        Yet when you look at me
        You make my thoughts calm

        How come we’re not meant to be
        Yet when you speak to me
        My soul feels at peace
        
        How come we’re not meant to be
        Yet when you hold me
        I suddenly feel warm

        How come we’re not meant to be
        Yet when you’re with me
        I finally feel home…
        
        How come we’re not meant to be
        Yet I feel so sick when you’re gone

        How come we’re not meant to be
        You’re so incredibly far
        How come we’re not meant to be
        But in my heart I know we are

        How come we’re not meant to be
        When yesterday you were in my arms
        How come we’re not meant to be
        Or did I simply ignore all the alarms?
        
        You are not just someone
        You are not just a memory
        You are supposed to be
        My eternity…
        
        How come we’re not meant to be…
        Tell me, how?
        How come we’re not meant to be?

        Tell me why anything that can rise
        Must inevitably suffer a fall?
        Explain to me how one’s love dies
        When it pierced the sky so tall?
        
        I hate you, but I love you more
        My heart aches for an answer
        An answer that I’ll despise to the core
        
        But how, how, how!?
        How can my best friend
        Become a stranger in a day?
        How could it possibly end
        In the most absurd of ways?

        How could I be so stupid
        To allow my best friend to walk away!?
        
        I will never forgive myself
        They say mistakes are lessons in disguise
        But I learned nothing except hate
        And fill my words with atrocious lies…

        Life is beautiful,
        I hate who I am
        I will never say,
        I love myself.

        There you were, sleeping so peacefully, the clouds moving in formation towards the end of our sights, the sunset light bouncing off them and landing on your cheek.

        We had planned this trip for ages, and we were finally flying above the seas reaching our destination.

        The stewardess was making her rounds, asking if all was well, until a wave of concern began haunting people’s expressions, everybody looked around in search of answers, no one knew what was going on.

        The only reassuring moment we had was from the crew’s calmness, but that quickly dissipated as the oxygen masks dropped.

        The non-believers started to pray, and the believers began accepting their fate, as we were plummeting towards the ocean.

        The plane was in a chaotic state, the world ended in everyone’s eyes, except yours, since you were still asleep. 

        You were still in such a peaceful state, drifting away in your own universe as we were about to drown in reality.

        And as the world around us seemed to be racing to survive, I held your hand and time started slowing down - until we crashed …

	"Dad, what are you writing?" Emma softly asked as she opened my office door.

	"Some things for work, honey. Hey… Isn't it your bedtime?" I ask her, looking into her sleepy eyes, putting my pen down, and closing the journal.

	"Yeah, but my favorite show was on!" she said with a smile.

	"It’s alright, come on, let’s go sleep. By the way, where’s your doll?" I lift her up to my arms, kissing her cheek, a soft kiss goodnight.

	"She’s sleeping, silly!" she replies with the happiest tone I’ve ever heard, a tone of voice I know all too well. 
	    
    "Oh! I see! Well now, you’re not going to let her sleep alone, are you?" I reply, holding her tight to me as we make our way to bed.
