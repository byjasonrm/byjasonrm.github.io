        If that's what you expect me to say, you're wrong.
        Our relationship meant nothing to me.
        I can't say that,
        I loved you.
        And to be honest,
        I hated you.
        I would be lying to myself if I said,
        I want to talk to you.
        Why is everything so different now?
        You might have an answer to share.
        But before you do,
        Leave.
