        No one can ever replace you
        
        I don’t want any foreign hands,
        Ruining the memory of yours
        
        I don’t want any eyes, 
        Looking into where you still live
        
        Maybe you’ll move on from me,
        But in my papers,
        We’re still meant to be…

        The world became quiet
        And I could feel my heart again.

        How you elegantly danced with it
        And kept it safe in your arms...
